# Two-Hour App #3: Creating a Bootstrap Page

One of my weaknesses is front-end design and development, so today I decided to take an hour to learn a little more about Bootstrap.

After building my Django environment and deploying to Heroku using [heroku-django](https://github.com/stevenrouk/heroku-django), I created a 'blog' app, added the necessary url adjustments, created the base template and a home page, then I added the Bootstrap links to the top of the base template and started taking a look at some Bootstrap examples. I decided to build one of their Jumbotron examples, which went smoothly.

I also installed [Emmet](http://emmet.io/) as a plugin for my [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) text editor, both of which I would highly recommend. Sublime Text is just a great code editor with a beautiful interface and lots of plugins available, and Emmet makes front-end development lightning fast. Check 'em out.

So that was all I did today, since I had a shorter app building session than usual. Hopefully tomorrow I'll build on the progress I made today, AND spend a full two hours on it.

Cheers.

Steven
